## Description

AS A developer

I WANT a README generator

SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

README Generator is a program that creates READMEs. As such:

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository

THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

WHEN I enter my project title

THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions

THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options 

THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

WHEN I enter my GitHub username

THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

WHEN I enter my email address

THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents

THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

This project was designed to familiarize myself better with Node.js. The completed project should allow me and whoever uses the program to more quickly and easily render README files for future projects and challenges, thus leaving more time to work with actual code. The READMEs should be high-quality and the template dynamic so that it can work in different situations. By the end, I should feel more comfortable with Node and back-end development, thus allowing me to continue confidently in my learning. 


## Installation

Links to the repository and deployed website can be found at [Questions](#questions).

Because this project runs from the machine and not the browser, it cannot be deployed. The project is on github, however. You must first clone the repo, then run the command "npm install" on the Terminal/Command Line in order to download the dependencies. From there, you can create your own README. 


## Usage

Once the project is cloned and the dependencies downloaded, type "node index" to run the program. The program will provide you with multiple prompts to fill out, including description, picking a license, lising credits, and so forth. Fill them out with your respective information. When you're done, your new README should appear in the dist folder for you to copy and place in your own personal project. 


## Credits

The coding boot camp Professional README Guide found at https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide was used as a template for this README. 
The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
Other credits include: 
Bootcamp Modules, Bootcamp Challenges, npm
No TAs or classmates were used in the making of this challenge. Most influence was taken particualrly from Module 9. Node.js and NPM's Inquirer were also used. 



## Contributing

Other items to be added can be badges, further options for credits, ways to easily upload screenshots, a way to easily toss in the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, and a place to add features. Any other additions are certainly welcome. Just don't break anything. 


## Tests

In order to test, you'll simply need to run the application and try out different combos. You can also create mock data to test the layout and presentation of that data.
